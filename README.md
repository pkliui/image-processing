# Independent coursework on image processing

## "Image and Video Processing" course by Prof. Guillermo Sapiro, Duke University

The course is based on the image processing book by Gonzalez and Woods. Here are my solutions to optional programming exercises.

[[**Week 1: Image quantization, filtering, rotation and downsampling**](image-and-video-processing/week1-image-quantisation-filtering-and-rotation/week1-image-quantisation-filtering-and-rotation.md)]: 
* Bit down-conversion
* Spatial averaging and box filters
* Image rotation
* Image downsampling

[[**Week 2: Image compression**](image-and-video-processing/week2-image-compression/week2-image-compression.md)]: 
* Basic implementation of JPEG

[[**Week 3: Spatial processing**](image-and-video-processing/week3-spatial-processing/week3-spatial-processing.md)]: 
* Histogram equalization
* Median filtering
* Non-local means

## Deep learning in computer vision by Dr. Anton Konushin, Higher School of Economics University
 
[[**Week 1: Image alignment**](deep-learning-in-computer-vision/week1/image_alignment_task.md)]

*Colour photography*
- removal of the photographic tapeâ€™s borders by Canny edge detector
- implementation of Canny edge detector
- spatial separation of the RGB channels
- channel alignment (pattern matching) by mean-squared-error and normalised cross-correlation

*Image alignment for face recognition*
- image rotation
- image centering
- image resizing
