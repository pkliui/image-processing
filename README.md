# Independent coursework on image processing

This documents records examples of my independent coursework on image processing.  I have plenty of experience in image processing in optical sciences. But it's never too late to learn something new or to explore familiar things from a different perspective!

## 'Classical' image processing 

### "Image and Video Processing" course by Prof. Guillermo Sapiro, Duke University

The course is based on the image processing book by Gonzalez and Woods. Here are my solutions to optional programming exercises.

[[Week 1](image-and-video-processing/week1-image-quantisation-filtering-and-rotation/week1-image-quantisation-filtering-and-rotation.md)]: 
* Bit down-conversion
* Spatial averaging and box filters
* Image rotation
* Image downsampling

[[Week 2: Image compression](image-and-video-processing/week2-image-compression/week2-image-compression.md)]: 
* Basic implementation of JPEG
